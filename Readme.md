      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Branch & Location Management

### Understanding Branch Structure

#### Location
- **Definition:** Geographic region or city (e.g., "Hyderabad", "Bangalore")
- **Scope:** Multiple branches can exist in one location
- **Example:** Hyderabad Main Campus, Hyderabad Branch 2 (both in Hyderabad)

#### Branch
- **Definition:** Individual school/campus within a location
- **Structure:** Each branch has unique code, name, and location assignment
- **Examples:**
  - HYD-MAIN: Hyderabad Main Campus
  - HYD-BRANCH2: Hyderabad Secondary Campus
  - BNG-MAIN: Bangalore Main Campus

#### Academic Year
- **Definition:** Academic session (e.g., "2024-2025", "2025-2026")
- **Scope:** All data is scoped to academic year
- **Usage:** Students, subjects, tests, grades all belong to specific academic year

### Branch Selection Workflow

```
Login → Fetch Allowed Branches
    ↓
User has access to multiple branches?
    ├─ YES: Show Branch Selector dropdown
    │   └─ User selects branch
    │       ├─ Update location based on branch
    │       ├─ Load branch-specific data
    │       └─ Apply branch filter to all queries
    │
    └─ NO: Auto-select single branch
        └─ Proceed with single branch
```

### Data Isolation by Branch

**Critical Principle:** All data is isolated by branch and location.

| Module | Isolation Scope |
|--------|-----------------|
| Students | Branch + Academic Year |
| Subjects | Academic Year (shared across branches in location) |
| Classes | Location-wide |
| Fee Types | Branch + Location + Academic Year |
| Grade Scales | Location + Academic Year |
| Tests | Branch + Location + Academic Year |
| Attendance | Branch + Location + Academic Year |

**Example:**
- Admin in "Hyderabad Main" branch cannot see students from "Bangalore Main" branch
- Grade scales created in HYD location apply to all HYD branches
- Each branch has independent fee structures

---

## Academic Management

### Academic Structure

#### 1. Subject Master (Subject Creation & Management)

**What is a Subject?**
- A course or topic taught at your institution
- Can be categorized as "Hifz" or "Academic"
- Scoped to specific academic year

**Subject Types:**
1. **Hifz Subjects:** Quranic memorization and Islamic studies
2. **Academic Subjects:** Regular school curriculum (Math, Science, English, etc.)

#### 2. Class Management

**What is a Class?**
- Grade level grouping (e.g., "Class 1", "Class 10", "Hifz-1")
- Has multiple sections (A, B, C, etc.)
- Students are enrolled in specific class and section
301: - Shared across all branches in a location
302: -> **Note:** Class visibility is configured per location. For example, "Delhi" location might show Classes 4-8, while "Hyderabad" shows Classes 6-8. This is system-configured.

**Class Data Structure:**
```
Class Master
├─ Class Name (e.g., "Class 10")
├─ Location (e.g., "Hyderabad")
├─ Branch (default: "All" = location-wide)
└─ Multiple Sections (A, B, C)
    └─ Students in Section
```

#### 3. Subject Assignment to Classes

**Workflow:**
```
1. Admin creates subjects (e.g., Mathematics, English, Quran)
   ├─ Subject Name
   ├─ Type (Hifz/Academic)
   └─ Academic Year
   
2. Academic Coordinator assigns subjects to classes
   ├─ Select Class (e.g., Class 10)
   ├─ Select Subjects to teach
   ├─ Define Academic Year
   ├─ Specify Location & Branch
   └─ Save Assignment
   
3. Result: Class now has assigned subjects
   └─ Teachers can enter grades for these subjects
```

**Example:**
- **Class 10** gets subjects: English, Mathematics, Science, Quran
- **Class 9** gets subjects: English, Mathematics, Science, Hifz, Islamic Studies
- Each class can have different subject combinations

### Step-by-Step: Create a Subject

**Navigation:** Academic → Academic Management → Subject Master

1. **Click "Create New Subject"**
2. **Fill Subject Form:**
   - Subject Name: `English Literature`
   - Subject Type: `Academic` (or `Hifz`)
   - Academic Year: `2025-2026`
   - Is Active: `✓ Checked`
3. **Click "Save"**
4. **Confirmation:** "Subject created successfully"

### Step-by-Step: Assign Subjects to Class

**Navigation:** Academic → Academic Management → Class Subject Assignment

1. **Select Academic Year:** `2025-2026`
2. **Select Location:** `Hyderabad`
3. **Select Branch:** `Hyderabad Main Campus`
4. **Select Class:** `Class 10`
5. **Select Subjects:**
   - ☑ English Literature
   - ☑ Mathematics
   - ☑ Science
   - ☑ Quran (Hifz)
6. **Click "Assign Subjects"**
7. **Confirmation:** "Subjects assigned successfully"

## Grade Scale Configuration

### What is a Grade Scale?

A grade scale defines how numerical marks are converted into letter grades.

**Example Grade Scales:**
```
Scale 1: Traditional (A-F)
├─ A: 90-100 marks
├─ B: 80-89 marks
├─ C: 70-79 marks
├─ D: 60-69 marks
├─ E: 50-59 marks
└─ F: 0-49 marks

Scale 2: Hifz Standard (Excellent-Poor)
├─ Excellent: 90-100 marks
├─ Very Good: 80-89 marks
├─ Good: 70-79 marks
├─ Satisfactory: 60-69 marks
├─ Needs Improvement: 50-59 marks
└─ Below Expected: 0-49 marks
```

### Grade Scale Scope & Isolation

**Location-Wide Scope:**
- Grade scales are created at **Location** level (e.g., "Hyderabad")
- Automatically apply to **all branches** in that location
394: ### Grade Scale Scope & Isolation
395: 
396: **Location-Wide Scope:**
397: - Grade scales are created at **Location** level (e.g., "Hyderabad")
398: - Automatically apply to **all branches** in that location
399: - **Not** branch-specific (even though API accepts branch parameter)
400: -> **Important:** Changes to a grade scale affect ALL branches in that location immediately. Ensure coordination between branches before modifying.

**Isolation Details:**
```
Grade Scale X (created in Hyderabad location)
├─ HYD-MAIN branch can use it
├─ HYD-BRANCH2 can use it
└─ Both branches use same scale
    (No duplication needed)
```

### Step-by-Step: Create a Grade Scale

         → Student gets Grade B

Math: 92 marks + Grade Scale (90-100 = A)
         → Student gets Grade A

Science: 88 marks
         → Student gets Grade B

Quran: 45 marks (out of 50)
         → Marks: 90/100 scale
         → Grade: A (Excellent)
```

756: Quran: 45 marks (out of 50)
757:          → Marks: 90/100 scale
758:          → Grade: A (Excellent)
759: ```

1320: 
1321: To ensure Report Cards and other documents print correctly without cutting off content or showing unwanted UI elements:
1322: 
1323: 1.  **Clean Print Mode:**
1324:     *   The system automatically hides sidebars, headers, and buttons when printing.
1325:     *   If you see "boxes" or UI elements, ensure you are using the official "Print" button, not the browser's generic print (`Ctrl+P`).
1326: 
1327: 2.  **Browser Settings:**
1328:     *   **Paper Size:** A4
1329:     *   **Margins:** Minimum or None (if content is cutting off)
1330:     *   **Scale:** Default (100%). If content spills to a second page unnecessarily, try reducing scale to 95% or 90%.
1331:     *   **Background Graphics:** Check this option to ensure charts and colored headers print correctly.
1332: 
1333: 3.  **Language Support:**
1334:     *   For charts containing Arabic/Urdu names, ensure your system has appropriate fonts installed to avoid empty boxes ("tofu" characters).
